Propulsion Subsystem motor thrust test. 

Goal: Determine the maximum thrust of the E-Flite Power 60 470 kv brushless electric motors.

This software will be controlled through serial terminal commands at 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. 

The commands are as follows:
M - Print this menu.
Q - Quit this program.
w - Increase motor throttle.
s - Decrease motor throttle.
x - Stop the motors.
